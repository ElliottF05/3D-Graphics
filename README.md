# 3D Graphics Engine

Homemade basic 3D graphics engine, built to understand how graphics work at a fundamental level.

This is an *extremely* basic 3D graphics engine, built entirely from the ground up to understand how 3D graphics work. There are many things I'd like to improve based on what I've learned since.

## Project Status: Paused

Currently on hold until I take linear algebra where I hope to learn math concepts applicable to 3D graphics.



## To-Do List (in no specific order):
- Improve organization of code
- Add OOP
- General bug fixes
- Add mouse-based camera controls
- Add 3d shape creation tools
- Add more advanced 3d graphics features (rendering triangles and faces instead of just lines)
